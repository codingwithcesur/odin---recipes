    <h2 class="titles">Making baklava with walnut in it</h2>
    <p>
      Baklava is a traditional pastry known for its sweet, rich flavor and flaky
      texture. It consists of phyllo (or filo) dough, nuts, spices, and a sugary
      syrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pronounce "baklava" like "bah-klah-vah." The stress is placed on the first
      syllable.
    </p>
    <h3 class="titles">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Phyllo Dough</li>
      <li>Nuts</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Cinnamon</li>
      <li>Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="titles">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Layer Phyllo with Nuts</li>
      <p>
        Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each
        layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped
        nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with
        the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut
        mixture is gone. Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering
        each layer.
      </p>
      <li>Cut and Bake</li>
      <p>
        Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the
        way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp.
      </p>
      <li>Finish With Syrup</li>
      <p>
        Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey.
        Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. Let
        cool before serving.
      </p>
