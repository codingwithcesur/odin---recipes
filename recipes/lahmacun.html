<h2>Making a lahmacun(turkish pizza)</h2>
<p>
  This Turkish-style pizza is a Turkish flat bread layered with a fresh sauce
  composed of tomatoes, sweet bell peppers, and minced lamb cooked with a
  flavorful selection of Mediterranean spices. It is normally garnished with
  fresh salad and a creamy garlic sauce and or a tangy zesty hot red pepper
  sauce. It is a really light meal, but filling and flavorful.

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat</li>
  <p>
    Combine the garlic, onion, basil, parsley, mint, paprika, cumin, coriander,
    diced bell peppers, lemon juice, and olive oil in a food processor. Pulse
    the vegetables until finely chopped. Add the halved tomatoes and process
    until the mixture is a thick puree.
  </p>
  <li>Place the lamb in the preheated skillet and reduce the heat to medium</li>
  <p>
    Add the puree and the tomato paste and mix well. Cook and stir until the
    lamb is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in cayenne pepper and salt to
    taste. Transfer the mixture to a shallow baking dish to cool to room
    temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
  </p>
  <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1 cup warm water</li>
  <p>
    Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl and stir well. Add the vegetable
    oil and 1/2 cup water to the yeast mixture and pour it over the flour. Use
    your hands to mix the dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
    surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
  </p>
  <li>Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to an oiled bowl</li>
  <p>
    Cover with a wet towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
    about 1 hour. Remove the lamb sauce from the refrigerator and allow it to
    come up to room temperature. Prepare the garlic sauce: combine the yogurt,
    parsley, crushed garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir well and set
    aside.
  </p>
  <li>
    Punch the dough down, transfer it to a floured work surface, and cut the
    dough into 10 portions
  </li>
  <p>
    Shape each portion into a round. Flatten each round with your hand; use a
    rolling pin to roll each piece into a 10-inch circle. The dough should be
    thin, like a crepe. Place the rounds on parchment paper.
  </p>
  <li>Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Stir the lamb sauce and then spoon it onto a dough round</li>
  <p>
    Spread it thinly to the edges and press down lightly so it sticks to the
    dough. Bake pizzas on parchment paper-lined baking sheets on the lowest oven
    rack until the edges are a light tan color, 8 to 10 minutes.
  </p>
  <li>Place on a wire rack to cool</li>
  <p>
    The pizzas can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for
    three days or in the freezer for three months. To reheat, place the pizzas
    in a 350 degree F oven (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes.
  </p>
  <li>
    To assemble the lahmacun, drizzle with garlic sauce, top with shredded
    cabbage, and roll up to eat.
  </li>
